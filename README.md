# advanceComputerVision
This contains the assignments given in IIT Delhi Advance Computer Vision Course (Course Code ELL-823).

The goal of this assignment is to ​find intrinsic and extrinsic camera calibration parameters​ of your mobile phone's camera.
Intrinsic calibration parameters include focal length, skew,
radial distortion parameters, other distortion parameters,
camera's optic center.
Extrinsic calibration parameters include Rotation, Translation
(and/or scale) computation for every photo taken by the mobile
phone.
The Use case is 2 fold. Indoor scenes and outdoor scenes.
Experiments shall be done separately for both data sets which
shall be collected by students themselves.
Calculate the error in calibration by computing the average reprojection error​ (in pixels) for all indoor, outdoor and both cases.
